# AIRBNB PRICE PREDICTION ASSIGNMENT

This repository is intended for the group members of the *Advanced Analytics in a Big Data World* course to collaborate for the first assignment (Airbnb price prediction).

- I have included a *create_venv.ps1* file that creates a virtual environment and installs the packages included in the *requirements.txt* file automatically.

- There are several packages in the requirements file, since the plan is to do some experiments with packages like *pycaret* (has a lot of dependencies, hence the big requirements file) and *torch*. The basic ones like *pandas*, *numpy* and *sklearn* are already included.
